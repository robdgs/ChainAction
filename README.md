<h3>What is ChainAction?</h3>
ChainAction is a Web3 application that allows users to create and sign petitions on the Arbitrum Sepolia chain. It ensures the anonymity of users interacting with the platform from anywhere in the world.

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
ChainAction leverages blockchain technology to provide a decentralized platform for creating and signing petitions. Users can create petitions, set goals for the number of signatures, and track the progress of their petitions. The platform ensures that all interactions are secure and anonymous.

## Development Tools

ChainAction is built using a combination of powerful development tools:

- **Scaffold-ETH**: Provides a robust framework for building decentralized applications on Ethereum. It includes a set of pre-configured tools and templates to streamline the development process.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Hardhat makes it easy to manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to developing smart contracts and dApps.
- **WAGMI**: A collection of React hooks that simplify the process of connecting to Ethereum wallets and interacting with smart contracts. WAGMI provides a seamless integration with the Ethereum ecosystem, making it easier to build user-friendly dApps.

## Programming Languages

ChainAction utilizes the following programming languages:

- **Solidity**: Used for writing the smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Used for the frontend and backend development. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types, making it easier to catch errors early and improve code quality.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
